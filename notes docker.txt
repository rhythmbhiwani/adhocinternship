Store the instructions in Dockerfile

FROM python
#it will check for python image in docker engine, if not present, then it will pull from DockerHUB

#developer of docker image [this is optional]
RUN mkdir /mydocker
#run instruction can execute any linux command inside my docker image that i will create
COPY test.py /mydocker/test.py
#it will copy code from local system to docker image
CMD python /mydocker/test.py
#this will run this code as default parent process
"""

#When files are stored on local file system
open powershell and go to project directory and run
"docker build -t rhythmpyimg1:pycodev1s ."
# . here means all files

or from github
"docker build -t rhythmimg2:v2 https://github.com/rhythmbhiwani/adhocsummerinternship.git"


now you can run it using
"docker run -it rhythmpyimg1:pycodev1s"
